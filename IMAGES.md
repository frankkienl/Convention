Images I need
=============

Google Play Store Required Images:
----------------------------
https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1078870?hl=en

- App Icon    
  Give me a 512x512, i'll resize it myself. (PNG)  
  Keep in mind that this image will be resized to a very small size (48x48), for very small phones.  
  I need one with and one without a background (transparent backround).  
  This image will be used on the Store-page, and in the application.  
  What I've done now:  
  <img width="144" height="144" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankkienl/Convention/master/screenshots/Amber_nobackground.png" alt="raw image"/>
  &nbsp; --&gt; &nbsp;
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankkienl/Convention/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png" alt="App Icon" />

- Feature Graphic  
  1024x500, no transparency, PNG (or JPG)  
  More info: see link  
  What I've got now:  
  <img width="512" height="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankkienl/Convention/master/screenshots/FeatureGraphic.png" alt="feature graphic" />    
  

- Screenshots  
  Don't worry about screenshots, I'll make those.  
  The app should have screenshots for smartphone, small tablet, large tablet. (I've got all of those covered)
  What I've got now:  
  <img width="384" height="640" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankkienl/Convention/master/screenshots/Phone/device-2014-12-19-100931.png" alt="screenshot" />

Other Images:
-------------
- Notification Icon  
  http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html#notification  
  Can only use gray and transparancy. (PNG) You can give me an colored (with transparency) 512x512, i'll put it through the Android Assets Studio.  
  But keep in mind that is will be very small (like 24x24) and all colors will be gray.
